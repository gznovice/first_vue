Test git function using visual source code
I always use git to download source code, seldom used it to store my work. I am trying to change that.
I will create a git respository to a vue project, setting up the IDE(visual source code) to finish the push/fetch actions.
Because using git seems professinal, doesn't it?

1. run ssh-keygen -o to generate ssh access key(make sure do not enter passphrase, because vs code doesn't support, and must run code after start-ssh-agent )
2. setup ssh key in the github setting.
3. npm run dev will setup a http server to test the web project.
4. npm run build will generate the build js.
